Project Integration: BA6/Business Pricing System

I examined your integration plan notes for combining "BA6" (Lazada product data) and "Business Pricing System" (pricing optimisation). Let me organise and offer ways to optimise your integration.

Improved Integration Plan

1. Architectural Project

combined-project/

Docker-compose.yml # Combined Docker configuration

The shared environment variables are listed in the env section.

Please see the combined gitignore file for further information.

Please refer to the comprehensive documentation in README.md.

Here are the frontend components for BA6.

- app.js

See package.json for details.

│   └── ...

Please refer to the shared API layer for further information.

Visit product_api/#BA6 product data APIs for further information.

Please refer to the price API section for further information on business pricing system APIs.

Check out the price engine for a complete business pricing system.

In main.py,

Create sample data in Python.

Collection of models

Use config/.

Please refer to the shared data directory for further information.

• Raw data, including Lazada CSV, is available.

Number of processed data:

- Output/Analysis findings

This script contains utility scripts.

    Connect-db.ps1 has a script for connecting to a database.

    Please refer to the setup.sh script for instructions.

    Train models in train_models.sh at # Script for training models

2. Docker configuration

docker-compose.yml1/1

3. Integrating Strategy





Integrating databases:



Make a single schema for both apps.



Add tables for both projects to db_schema_enhanced.sql.



API Layer:



A single API for the frontend and pricing engine



Create product data retrieval and pricing optimisation endpoints.



Flow of Data



Use BA6 to import Lazada product data.



Process and save this data in the shared database.



Business Pricing System analyses and optimises this data.



Optimised pricing suggestions return to frontend

4. SetupScript

setup.sh1/1

Five Implementation Steps





Setting up Project Structure:



Set up the directory structure above.



Move files from both projects to their places.



Configuring Docker:



Combine docker-compose.yml.



Make sure all services communicate.



Database setup:



Combining project database schemas



Create migration scripts if required.



API Integration:



Create a single API.



Enable communication between systems using this layer.



Frontend Integration:



Change the frontend to show price suggestions



Create price optimisation UI components.



Testing:



Individually test each part



Check integration to make sure everything works.
